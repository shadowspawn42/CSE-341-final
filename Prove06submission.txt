5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
I loved learning about how to get URLs to work on the heroku servers. I wanted to make
sure that the password resetting links worked on the server and on my home environment.
It took some time to realize that I could just do the same thing that we do in the base
index file of having an "or" statement. I felt so happy when I got it to work.

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
Fixed a few errors with editing and updating products that I found that doesn't happen often

I also put another intersting fact.
I think I finally understand how to do the routing.
